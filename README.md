the project if forked from [tdjackey/autoAnswer](https://github.com/tdjackey/autoAnswer)。 

I added a feature for it. 

after the phone is picked up automatically, some mp3 on the sd card will be played 
and the speaker is turned on at the same time。

currently, the mp3 file is sdcard/Music/tongnian.mp3
